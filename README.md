# Bearing RUL Prediction

A machine learning pipeline for predicting the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of ball bearings using sensor data (vibration, temperature, speed, and force). The project was developed modularly with local MLflow tracking and later integrated into Azure ML for scalable training and inference.

## 🧪 Workflow Overview

1. **Modular Codebase**: Clean separation of data, features, models, and prediction logic.
2. **Local MLflow Tracking**: Run experiments locally and log parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
3. **Notebook-to-Script Conversion**: Prototyped in notebooks, converted to CLI scripts (`combine_data.py`, `train_model.py`, etc.).
4. **Azure ML Integration**:
   - Data stored in Azure Blob Storage
   - ML pipelines run modular stages: data prep → feature engineering → training → RUL prediction
   - Models tracked in Azure-backed MLflow and registered for batch/real-time inference

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run MLflow tracking server (optional)**:
   ```bash
   mlflow ui
   ```

3. **Run data combination**:
   ```bash
   python src/data/combine_sensor_data.py
   ```

4. **Train model**:
   ```bash
   python src/models/train_model.py --config config.yaml
   ```

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the [PRONOSTIA bearing dataset](https://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Software/PRONOSTIA) from the IEEE PHM 2012 Prognostic Challenge, containing sensor readings (vibration, temperature, speed, and force) collected under accelerated degradation.
